# My first custom drone environment

### Description:
A camera-equipped UAV can fly over the environment to be monitored to optimize the visual coverage of high-relevance areas. 
        
The drone starts ****, and the goal is to adopt a patrolling strategy to opimize the PARTIAL coverage throught time.

### Observation:
     
Let's assume that the map is of grid size WxH (5x5). Position of the drone is represented as (grid x index, grid y index), where (0,0) is the top left of the grid ((W-1,H-1)(4,4) is max value)) z-pos is the hight (Z is maximum flying height);
     
Type: Box(4)

Num |    Observation    |   Min   |    Max
----|-------------------|---------|-----------
0   |    Current x-pos  |    0    |  (W-1)=4
1   |    Current y-pos  |    0    |  (H-1)=4
2   |    Current z-pos  |    0    |  (Z-1)=4
3   |    Terrain angle  |    0    |    2*pi 

### Actions:

Type: Discrete(9)

Num  |  Action
-----|------------------
0    |  None
1    |  MoveForward
2    |  MoveBackward
3    |  MoveLeft
4    |  MoveRight      
5    |  MoveUp
6    |  MoveDown    
7    |  RotateLeft
8    |  RotateRight         

### Reward:

A matrix value   


### Starting State:
All observations are assigned a uniform random value in [1..2]
